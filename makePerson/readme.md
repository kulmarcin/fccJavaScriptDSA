<h1>Make a Person</h1>

<strong>I had to do this challenge in vanilla JavaScript because the only way to use keyword THIS in Typescript is in Classes - we can't implement traditional functions to create classes in TypeScript. </strong>

Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)

Run the tests to see the expected output for each method. The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string. These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.
